# Overview

Our project is about creating an applications that can be used to buy and sell various traditional Indonesian artworks, which are expected to help the economy of Indonesian traditional artists. For people who don't know about Indonesian arts, we also provide various literature and articles that can add insight to ordinary people. To make it easier, we also provide a smart camera feature so that people can explore the various arts they encounter.
